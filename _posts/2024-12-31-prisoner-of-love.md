<div class="poem-container">
  <p class="poem-line">When you vanished with your magic,<br> 
    Piercing this lover with your concealed blade.<br> 
    Defying death, I surrendered to your prison of love,<br> 
    Consumed by dread, if you would set me free.</p>
  
  <p class="poem-line">Prisoner for life was I,<br> 
    Imprisoned by a glance of your eye.<br> 
    You thought I would flee,<br> 
    Oh my Jailor! Please come back and see.</p>
  
  <p class="poem-line">I am cuffed to the scent of our memories,<br> 
    After your glance made this free man into a refugee.<br> 
    Your fleeting footsteps hum the sweetest symphony,<br> 
    Making my heartbeat align in its synchrony.</p>
  
  <p class="poem-line">Oh my dear Jailor! Let this prisoner sin,<br> 
    To love you and be the prisoner of time.<br> 
    As our soulless bodies wash away with the tide,<br> 
    Let our souls be imprisoned forever in this rhyme.</p>
