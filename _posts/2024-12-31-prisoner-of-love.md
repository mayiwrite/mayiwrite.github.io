When you vanished with your magic,
Piercing this lover with your concealed blade.
Cheating death, I embraced your prison of love,
Consumed by dread, if you would set me free.
  
Prisoner for life was I,
Imprisoned by a glance of your eye.
You thought I would flee,
Oh my Jailor! Please come back and see.
  
I am cuffed to the scent of our memories, 
After your glance made this free man into a refugee. 
Your footsteps walking by, is the sweetest symphony, 
Making my heartbeat align in its synchrony.
  
Oh my dear Jailor! Let this prisoner sin,
To love you and be the prisoner of time.
As our soulless bodies wash away with the tide,
Let our souls be imprisoned forever in this rhyme.
