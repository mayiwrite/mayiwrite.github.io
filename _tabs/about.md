<div class="intro">
  <p>A space where love finds a voice, where emotions unfold like soft petals on a page.</p>
</div>

<div class="content">
  <p>I am a poet, a dreamer, and, above all, a lover. This book of poems is so much more than just words—it is a glimpse inside my heart, a celebration of the love I share with my girl. It speaks of the silent moments, the guffaws of laughter, and how love makes life so wonderfully whole.</p>

  <p>I write for her—my muse, my sunflower. She is the warmth in my day and the calm in my night. Her presence infuses meaning into my words and light into every line. Each time I write, I try to capture how her smile feels like home, how her laughter lingers in the air, and how she looks at me as if I am her whole world.</p>

  <p>Poetry allows me to say what can't always be spoken aloud. It is how I hold on to the beauty of our relationship, a reflection of how I see her—not just the person I love but as the sun my world orbits around. Each poem is a love letter, a part of my soul given to the woman who makes my life richer and fuller in ways I never imagined.</p>

  <p>This is a space for those who believe in the quiet power of love, the magic of words, and the beauty of raw emotion. It is a place of exploration—of what it means to love deeply and live fully. Through these poems, I hope to remind you that love—real, imperfect, and endless—has the power to shape us all.</p>

  <p>Thank you for being here, for letting my words speak to your heart. I hope they echo your own moments of love and remind you that, in its truest form, love is always worth celebrating.</p>
